🎉 Fun Calculator 🎉
Welcome to the Fun Calculator, where we add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers like a boss! 😎 Whether you're brushing up on Python basics or want a quick, interactive number cruncher, this script is a playful and clear way to learn.

🚀 Features
✅ Takes two user inputs and supports decimal numbers (using float).
✅ Calculates sum, difference, product, and quotient.
✅ Provides clear, friendly output for each operation.
✅ Simple structure for Python beginners to understand input, computation, and output.

🛠️ How It Works
Prompts you to enter the first number.

Prompts you to enter the second number.

Calculates:

➕ Sum

➖ Difference

✖️ Product

➗ Quotient

Displays each result in a clear, fun format.

📋 Example Run
Enter the first number: 8
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 10.0
Difference: 6.0
Product: 16.0
Quotient: 4.0
⚠️ Note
This calculator does not currently handle division by zero, so please avoid entering 0 as the second number when testing division.

Ideal for learning purposes and practicing how to handle input, data types, basic arithmetic, and formatted output in Python.

💻 Running the Script
1️⃣ Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3+ recommended).
2️⃣ Save the code in a file, for example, fun_calculator.py.
3️⃣ Run in your terminal or VS Code:

bash
Copy
Edit
python fun_calculator.py
✏️ How to Extend
Add error handling for division by zero.

Allow the user to choose which operation they want to perform.

Format the output to limit decimal places.

Wrap operations in functions for reusability.

Add unit tests to practice test-driven development.

🤝 Contributing
Feel free to fork, improve, or turn this into a GUI calculator using Tkinter or a web calculator using Flask for practice!

🥳 Enjoy Crunching Numbers!
Happy learning, and may your coding journey be as fun as your calculations! 🚀✨
